Here's a list of all commands of this cog:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
instantcommand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Syntax**::

    [p][instacmd|instantcmd|instantcommand]

**Description**

This is the main command used for setting up the code. 
It will be used for all other commands.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
instantcommand create
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Syntax**::

    [p]instantcommand create

**Description**

Creates a new command/listener from a code snippet.

You will be asked to give a code snippet which will contain your function. 
It can be a command (you will need to add the ``commands`` decorator) or a listener 
(your function name must correspond to an existing discord.py listener).

.. tip:: Here are some examples
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        @roleset.command()
        @commands.command()
        async def command(ctx, *, argument):
            """Say your text with some magic"""

            await ctx.send("You excepted to see your text, "
                            "but it was I, Dio!")
                            
    .. code-block:: python
    
        async def on_reaction_add(reaction, user):
            await reaction.message.add_reaction('‚ù§')
            await message.channel.send("Here's some love for " + user.mention)
