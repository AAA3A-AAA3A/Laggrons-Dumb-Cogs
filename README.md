# Laggron's dumb cogs

Hi I'm **El Laggron** from [Twentysix's Discord server](https://discord.gg/red) and I made this cog because I'm bored. Just that. And don't expect a lot from me, if the cog you're using works, this is mostly luck (or dark magic) because I'm a quite shit dev. 

If you have any ideas of cogs I should make, contact me in DM. 

Also I should credit **UltimatePancake** and **Sentry** who helped me a lot on cog creation (not Kowlin who just spit on me).

If you like these cogs, please consider donating at [Twentysix](https://www.patreon.com/Twentysix26) (surprising ?) because he way more deserves it than me C:
