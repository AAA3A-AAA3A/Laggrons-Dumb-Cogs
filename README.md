# Laggron's dumb cogs

Hi I'm **El Laggron** from [Twentysix's Discord server](https://discord.gg/red) and I made this cog because I'm bored. Just that. And don't expect a lot from me, if the cog you're using works, this is mostly luck (or dark magic) because I'm a quite shit dev. 

If you have any ideas of cogs I should make, contact me in DM. 

Also I should credit **UltimatePancake** and **Sentry** who helped me a lot on cog creation (not Kowlin who just spit on me).

If you like these cogs, please consider donating at [Twentysix](https://www.patreon.com/Twentysix26) (surprising ?) because he way more deserves it than me C:

## How to install one of my cogs

Type the following command (if not responding, make sure you are the bot owner, the bot has access to your channel and the cog `downloader.py` is loaded (`[p]load downloader` if not):

`[p]cog repo add Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs`

Then to install a cog type this command:

`[p]cog install Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs <cog name>`

## Usage

Here is a short tuto on how to use my cogs. `[p]` is your prefix.

### Say

`[p]send here <message>` Send your message in the actual channel.

`[p]send channel <#channel_mention> <message>` Send your message in the given channel.

`[p]send upload <file.name> [comment (optional)]` Upload and send the give file in the local data folder, with an optional comment.

`[p]send dm <user.mention> <message>` Send the exact message you gave to a user in private message (instead of whisper which add the message author)

For file upload, you need to put your files in `/data/say/upload`. Then type the following command `[p]send upload myfile.png`

You can remove `.png`, the bot should find it, except if two files has the same name! Also **don't put files with spaces in its name or it won't work**

`[p]send autodelete` Enable auto deletion of the message that invoked the command. This will only if the bot has the `Manage messages` permission and on the commands of this cog (for autodeletion of all commands, look at `[p]modset deletedelay`)

### Bettermod

`[p]report @user <reason>` This will send a message in the mod log, set before, with the reason. Anyone can use this command and the message that invoked the command will be default auto delete.

`[p]warn` This will send a warning to the specified user, with the reason. This will also be sent in the modlog channel and the message that invoked the command will be auto delete. You will be able to check user's warns later. This command work with the following subcommands:

- `[p]warn <1|simple> @user <reason>` Works as said before. The reason is required

- `[p]warn <2|kick> @user <reason>` Same as before, but it will kick the user.

- `[p]warn <3|ban> @user <reason>` Same as beforeÂ², but it will ban the user.

You can also set multiple settings, some are required:

`[p]bmodset` This is the commands that will allow you to set everything:

- `[p]bmodset channel <channel mention>` This will set the modlog channel.

- `[p]bmodset color <report|simple|kick|ban>` This set the color bar of the differents embed messages that can be send in the modlog.

-  `[p]bmodset thumbnail <report|simple|kick|ban>` This set the thumbnail of the differents embed messages (the small picture at the top right) that can be send in the modlog.
