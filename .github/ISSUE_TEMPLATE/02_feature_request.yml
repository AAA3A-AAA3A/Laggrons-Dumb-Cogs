        Feel free to describe in as much detail as you wish.

        If you are requesting a command:
          - Include what cog it should be in and a name for the command
          - Describe the intended functionality for the command
          - Note any restrictions on who can use the command or where it can be used

        If you are requesting API functionality:
          - Describe what it should do
          - Note whether it is to extend existing functionality or introduce new functionality

        If you are requesting a new cog: 
          - Describe the functionality in as much detail as possible
          - Include the command structure, if possible
          - Please note that there are few chances I actually make new cogs
            based on suggestions (but could always happen).
          - If you're asking for a commission, DM me (El Laggron) or use the [cogboard](https://cogboard.discord.red/)
